# ChordLab — MiniLab 3 Chord Builder

Transform the Arturia MiniLab 3 into a performance-ready chord workstation. ChordLab ships with a Python MIDI engine, WebMIDI control surface, and utilities for lighting the pads / OLED display with live feedback.

> This repository mirrors the structure described in the project brief. Each tool can run independently or be combined for a full live setup.

## Project Layout

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `chord_builder.py` | Python chord engine that interprets pad/keyboard input and emits harmonised chords |
| `minilab3_display_colors.py` | Helpers for building SysEx payloads that light the pads and update the OLED |
| `midi_logger.py` | Simple CLI utility for mirroring and debugging MIDI traffic |
| `tests/` | Pytest suite covering the core chord engine behaviour |
| `minilab-ui/` | Vite + React WebMIDI dashboard for pushing pad colours and OLED text |
| `assets/` | Visual assets referenced in documentation |
| `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` | Project brief with hardware mapping and goals |

## Getting Started (Python Engine)

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
```

> The repository ships with a tiny `mido_stub` so tests can run without system MIDI drivers. For real hardware interaction, install the official `mido` package.

### 2. Run the chord engine in a DAW setup

```python
from mido import open_input, open_output
from chord_builder import MiniLabChordEngine

with open_input('MiniLab3 In') as in_port, open_output('IAC Driver ChordOut') as out_port:
    engine = MiniLabChordEngine(out_port)
    for message in in_port:
        engine.process_message(message)
```

### 3. Running the tests

```bash
pytest
```

### 4. CLI runner

Run the engine without writing any Python glue:

```bash
# List ports
python run_engine.py --list

# Auto-pick ports (MiniLab for input/feedback, IAC for output)
python run_engine.py --auto

# Or specify ports explicitly
python run_engine.py --in "MiniLab" --out "IAC Driver Bus 1" --fb "MiniLab"
```

---

## Web UI (WebMIDI)

The `minilab-ui` directory contains a Vite project that can send SysEx commands directly from the browser (Chrome / Edge).

```bash
cd minilab-ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed URL in a WebMIDI-compatible browser, select the MiniLab output, and use the controls to update pad colours / OLED lines.

---

## Utilities

### MIDI Logger

List available input ports and monitor data flowing through them while optionally forwarding to another destination:

```bash
python midi_logger.py "MiniLab3 In" "IAC Driver ChordOut"
```

### SysEx Helpers

Generate raw SysEx payloads for use with other tools or hardware testing rigs:

```python
from minilab3_display_colors import RGB, build_pad_color_sysex

sysex = build_pad_color_sysex('PAD_21', RGB(120, 40, 10))
```
